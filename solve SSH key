This error message is indicating that you need to add a public SSH key to your GitHub account in order to clone a repository over SSH. Here's how to solve it:

Generate a new SSH key: If you don't already have an SSH key, you can generate one by running the following command in your terminal:


Copy code
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
Replace "your_email@example.com" with your actual email address.

Add your public key to GitHub: After generating the key, you can add it to your GitHub account by following these steps:

Open the terminal and run the following command to display your public key:

Copy code
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
Copy the output of this command.

Log in to your GitHub account and go to the "Settings" page.

Click on "SSH and GPG keys" on the left-side menu.

Click on the "New SSH key" button.

Give your key a descriptive title, paste the public key into the "Key" field, and then click the "Add SSH key" button.

Clone the repository over SSH: After adding your public key to GitHub, you should now be able to clone the repository over SSH. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

bash
Copy code
git clone git@github.com:user/repo.git
Replace "user/repo" with the actual repository you want to clone.

That's it! You should now be able to clone the repository without encountering the "You don't have any public SSH keys in your GitHub account" error message.
