Use a credential helper: You can set up a credential helper to store your username and password, so you don't need to enter them each time you push. To set up a credential helper, follow these steps:

Configure the Git credential helper:
Copy code
git config --global credential.helper store
Push to the repository:
Copy code
git push origin 
The first time you push, you will be prompted for your username and password. Git will then store the credentials in a file, so you won't need to enter them again.
